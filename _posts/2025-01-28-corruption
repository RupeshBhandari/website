In May 2024, Nepal's Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed corruption charges against six individuals, including Akbar Hussain, the CEO of Max International. The charges were related to procurement irregularities at the Security Printing Center (SPC), causing significant financial losses to the government.

## Allegations and Charges

The CIAA accused the defendants of misusing funds during the procurement process for the SPC. Instead of purchasing the specified Card-Based Press machinery, software, and related hardware, the defendants procured two high-capacity printing presses deemed unnecessary and an IT system that remained unused. This misconduct allegedly caused a financial loss exceeding NPR 400 million to the government.

The individuals charged in the case were:

- **Bikal Poudel**: Former Executive Director of the SPC  
- **Safal Shrestha**: Former Director of the National Information Technology Centre  
- **Navin Kumar Pokharel**: Employee at the Ministry of Forest and Environment  
- **Khadga Bahadur Thapa**: Former Accountant of the SPC  
- **Hari Ballav Ghimire**: Former Section Officer of the SPC  
- **Akbar Hussain**: CEO of Max International  

The CIAA demanded a fine of NPR 408,574,740 from each defendant and sought their punishment in accordance with the *Prevention of Corruption Act, 2002* (The Rising Nepal, 2024).

## Max International's Anti-Corruption Policy

Max International has publicly expressed its commitment to global anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act. The company's anti-corruption policy explicitly prohibits:

- Offering, promising, requesting, authorizing, or accepting bribes, directly or indirectly.  
- Failing to maintain internal policies and controls for compliance with anti-corruption laws.  
- Neglecting due diligence when engaging with third parties.  

Violations of these policies are subject to severe consequences, including termination of relationships and legal repercussions (Max International, n.d.).

## Implications and Reforms

This case underscores systemic challenges within Nepal's public procurement processes. The involvement of high-ranking officials and business leaders highlights the need for comprehensive reforms to ensure transparency and accountability.

The CIAA's proactive efforts to investigate and prosecute such cases reflect a commitment to combating corruption. However, the ultimate effectiveness of these measures will depend on the judicial process and the implementation of broader institutional reforms.

As the case unfolds, it will serve as a critical test of Nepal's resolve to uphold the principles of good governance and transparency.
